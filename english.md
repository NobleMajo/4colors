# 4-Color Model

*(inspired by “Surrounded by Idiots” by Thomas Erikson)*

In the book `Surrounded by Idiots`, *Thomas Erikson* divides personalities into **four colors**.
Each color represents a different way of seeing, thinking, and reacting to the world.
The colors are a simplified model for behavioral styles and communication preferences.

No one is just *one* color – most people are a **mix of several**.
But knowing which color is **most dominant** in you helps enormously to understand yourself and others – for example, why you harmonize with some people and clash with others more often.

The goal is not to put you in a box,
but to help you **better understand yourself and others** – for example, why you behave a certain way in specific situations and why others sometimes react very differently than you would expect.

## Self-Test

Let's start with a test to help you identify your own color tendency.

With the following two questions, you can probably detect a tendency.
After that, make sure to check the extra questions to become even more aware of your tendencies.

### 1️⃣ Are you more **extroverted** or **introverted**?

* **Extroverted:**
  You **gain energy** from being around other people.
  You enjoy talking, sharing ideas, and feel alive in groups.

* **Introverted:**
  You **lose energy** if you spend too long with many people.
  You need **time alone** to recharge and reflect.

👉 **Tip:** It's not about being *shy* or *loud* –
but about **where your energy comes from**.

### 2️⃣ Are you more **emotional** or **logical**?

* **Emotional:**
  You make decisions more **from your gut**.
  You are **spontaneous, empathetic**, and enjoy being guided by feelings.

* **Logical:**
  You **think first**, analyze, and make decisions **based on facts**.
  You are more **thoughtful, calm, and like to plan**.

👉 Again: both are important – the difference is only in **which is stronger for you**.
